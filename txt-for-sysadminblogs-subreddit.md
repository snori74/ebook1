TITLE: Commandline/sysadmin course in r/linuxupskillchallenge

This month-long challenge for anyone wanting to build Linux sysadmin skills is re-starting again the first Monday of next month.

Daily lessons appear in  the sub-reddit /r/linuxupskillchallenge  - which is also be used for support/discussion.  This is a 'rolling' course repeated each month. Does require some serious commitment, but if gaining/growing these skills is something you've been meaning to do, then you now have no excuse!

Any feedback very welcome.
