# Day 6 - Editing with "vim"

## INTRO

Simple text files are at the heart of Linux, so editing these is a key sysadmin skill. There are a range of simple editors aimed at beginners such as: _nano_, _pico_, _joe_ or _jed_ . These all look horribly ugly, and as if they were written for DOS back in the 1980's - but are pretty easy to "just figure out".

The Real Sysadmin however, uses _vi_  - this is the editor that's always installed - and today you'll get started using it.

Bill Joy wrote _vi_ back in the mid 1970's - and even the "modern" descendant _vim_ that we'll concentrate on is over 20 years old, but despite their age, these remain the standard editors on command-line server boxes. Additionally, they have a loyal following among programmers, and even some writers.

Very often when you type _vi_, what the system actually starts is _vim_. To see if this is true of your system type:

     vi --version

to check.

## THE TWO THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

* There are two "modes" - with very different behaviours
* Little or nothing onscreen lets you know which mode you're currently in!

The two modes are "command mode" and "editing mode", and as a beginner, there is one simple technique to remember - simply:

_"Press Esc twice or more to return to command mode"_

## INSTRUCTIONS

So, first grab a text file to edit. A copy of _/etc/services_ will do nicely:

     cd   
     pwd
     cp -v /etc/services testfile   
     vim testfile

At this point we have the file on screen, and we are in "command mode". Unlike _nano_, however, there’s no onscreen menu and it's not at all obvious how anything works!

Start by pressing _Esc_ once or twice to ensure that we are in command mode (remember this trick from above), then type _:q!_ and press _Enter_. This quits without saving any changes - a _vital_ first skill when you don't yet know what you're doing!
Now let's go in again and play around, seeing how powerful and dangerous _vim_ is - then again, quit without saving:

     vim testfile

Use the keys _h_ _j_ _k_ and _l_ to move around (this is the traditional _vi_ method) then try using the arrow keys - if these work, then feel free to use them - but remember those _hjkl_ keys though because one day you may be on a system with just the traditional _vi_ and the arrow keys won't work.

Now play around moving through the file. Then exit with _Esc_  _Esc_  _:q!_ as discussed earlier.

Now that you've mastered that, lets get more advanced.

     vim testfile

This time, move down a few lines into the file and press _3_ then _3_ again, then _d_ and _d_ again - and suddenly 33 lines of the file are deleted! 

Why? Well, you are in command mode and _33dd_ is a command that says "delete 33 lines". Now, you're still in command mode, so press _u_ - and you've magically undone the last change you made. Neat huh?

Now you know the three basic tricks for a newbie to _vim_:

* _Esc_ _Esc_ always gets you back to "command mode"
* From command mode  _:q!_ will always quit without saving anything you've done, and
* From command mode _u_ will undo the last action

So, here's some useful, productive things to do:

* Finding things: From command mode, type _GG_ to get to the bottom of the file, then _gg_ to get to the top. Let's search for references to "sun", type _/sun_ to find the first instance, then press _n_ repeatedly to step through all the next occurrences. Now go to the top of the file (_gg_ remember) and try searching for "_Apple_" or "_Microsoft_".
* Cutting and pasting: Go back up to the top of the file (with _gg_) and look at the first few lines of comments (the ones with "#" as the first character.  Play around with cutting some of these out and pasting them back. To do this simply position the cursor on a line, then (for example),  type _11dd_ to delete 11 lines, then immediately paste them back in by pressing _P_ - and then move down the file a bit and paste the same 11 lines in there again with _P_
* Inserting text: Move anywhere in the file and press _i_ to get into "insert mode" (it may show at the bottom of the screen) and start typing - and _Esc_ _Esc_ to get back into command mode when you're done.
* Writing your changes to disk: From command mode type _:w_ or _:wq_ to “write and quit”.

This is as much as you ever _need_ to learn about _vi_ - but there's an enormous amount more you could learn if you had the time - just don't bother going there until after you've finished this course!

However, if you're serious about becoming a sysadmin, it's important that you _commit_ to using _vim_ for all your editing from now on.

One last thing, you may see reference to _"vi versus emacs"_ . This is a long running argument for programmers, not system administrators - _vi/vim_  is what you need to learn.

## EXTENSION
If you're already familiar with _vi_ / _vim_ then use today's hour to research and test some customisation via your _~/.vimrc_ file. The link below is specifically for sysadmins:
