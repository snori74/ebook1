# Day 19 - Inodes, symlinks and stat

## INTRO

Today's topic gives a peek “under the covers” at the technical detail of how files are stored.

Linux supports a large number of different “filesystems” - although on a server you’ll typically be dealing with just _ext3_ or _ext4_  and perhaps _btrfs_ - but today we’ll not be dealing with any of these; instead with the layer of Linux that sits _above_ all of these - the Linux Virtual Filesystem. 

The VFS is a key part of Linux, and an overview of it and some of the surrounding concepts is very useful in confidently administering a system.

## THE NEXT LAYER DOWN
Linux has an extra layer between the filename and the file's actual data on the disk - this is the _inode_. This has a numerical value which you can see most easily in two ways:

The `-i` switch on the `ls` command:

     ls -li /etc/hosts
     35356766 -rw------- 1 root root 260 Nov 25 04:59 /etc/hosts

The `stat` command:

     stat /etc/hosts
     File: `/etc/hosts'
     Size: 260       	Blocks: 8      	IO Block: 4096   regular file
     Device: 2ch/44d	Inode: 35356766	Links: 1
     Access: (0600/-rw-------)  Uid: (	0/	root)   Gid: (	0/	root)
     Access: 2012-11-28 13:09:10.000000000 +0400
     Modify: 2012-11-25 04:59:55.000000000 +0400
     Change: 2012-11-25 04:59:55.000000000 +0400

Every file name "points" to an inode, which in turn points to the actual data on the disk. This means that several filenames could point to the same inode - and hence have exactly the same contents. In fact this is a standard technique - called a "hard link". The other important thing to note is that when we view the permissions, ownership and dates of filenames, these attributes are actually kept at the inode level, _not_ the filename. Much of the time this distinction is just theoretical, but it can be very important.


## TWO SORTS OF LINKS
Work through the steps below to get familiar with hard and soft linking:

First move to your home directory with:

`cd`

Then use the `ln` ("link") command to create a “hard link”, like this:

`ln /etc/passwd link1`

and now a "symbolic link" (or “symlink”), like this:

`ln -s /etc/passwd link2`

Now use `ls -li` to view the resulting files, and `less` or `cat` to view them.

Note that the permissions on a symlink generally show as allowing everthing - but what matters is the permission of the file it points to.

Both hard and symlinks are widely used in Linux, but symlinks are especially common - for example:

`ls -ltr /etc/rc2.d/*`     	

This directory holds all the scripts that start when your machine changes to “runlevel 2” (it's normal running state) - but you'll see that in fact most of them are symlinks to the real scripts in _/etc/init.d_

It's also very common to have something like :

     prog
     prog-v3
     prog-v4

where the program "prog", is a symlink - originally to v3, but now points to v4 (and could be pointed back if required)

Read up in the resources provided, and test on your server to gain a better understanding. In particular, see how permissions and file sizes work with symbolic links versus hard links or simple files


## The Differences

Hard links:

* Only link to a file, not a directory
* Can't reference a file on a different disk/volume
* Links will reference a file even if it is moved
* Links reference inode/physical locations on the disk

Symbolic (soft) links:

* Can link to directories
* Can reference a file/folder on a different hard disk/volume
* Links remain if the original file is deleted
* Links will NOT reference the file anymore if it is moved
* Links reference abstract filenames/directories and NOT physical locations.
* They have their own inode
