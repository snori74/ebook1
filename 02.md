# Day 2 - Basic navigation

## INTRO
Most computer users outside of the Linux and Unix world don't spend much time at the command-line now, but as a Linux sysadmin this is your default working environment - so you need to be skilled in it.

When you use a graphic desktop such as Windows or Apple's OS X (or even the latest Linux flavors), then increasingly you are presented with simple "places" where your stuff is stored - "Pictures" "Music" etc but if you're even moderately technical then you'll realize that underneath all this is a hierarchical  "directory structures" of "folders" (e.g. *C:\\Users\\Steve\\Desktop* on Windows or */Users/Steve/Desktop* on OS X - and on a Desktop Linux system */home/steve/Desktop*)

_From now on, the course will point you to a range of good online resources for a topic, and then set you a simple set of tasks to achieve. It’s perfectly fine to google for other online resources, refer to any books you have etc - and in fact a *fundamental element* of the design of this course is to force you to do a bit of your own research. Even the most experienced sysadmins will do an online search to find advice for how to use commands - so the sooner you too get into that habit the better!_

## YOUR TASKS TODAY
* Use the provided resources check out the basic commands and concepts and commands
* Login to your server via SSH and move about the directory structure at the command-line
* Take note of how your “prompt” changes as you change directory
* Be sure to understand how *cd* on it’s own takes you back to your “home directory”
* Understand what cd ~ and _cd .._ do 
* Use the *ls* command to list the contents of directories, and try several of the “switches” - in particular *ls -ltr* to show the most recently altered file last
* Use the *mkdir* command to create a new directory (folder) *test* in your home folder ( e.g _/home/support/test_)

## STEP-BY-STEP 
*  login to your server using ssh
* _/_ is the "root" of a branching tree of folders (also known as directories)
* at all time you are "in" one part of the system - the command _pwd_ ("present working directory") will show you where you are
* generally your prompt is also configured to give you at least some of this information, so if I'm "in" the _/etc_ directory then the prompt might be "steve@202.203.203.22: /etc>$" or simply "/etc: $"
* _cd_ or _chdir_ moves to different areas - so _cd /var/log_ will take you into the _/var/log_ folder - do this and then check with _pwd_ - and look to see if your prompt changes to reflect your location.
* you can move "up" the structure by typing _cd .._ ( "cee dee dot dot ") try this out by first _cd_'ing to _/var/log/_ then _cd .._ and then _cd .._ again - watching your prompt carefully, or typing pwd each time, to clarify your present working directory.
* a "relative" location is based on your present working directory - e.g. if you first _cd /var_ then pwd will confirm that you are "in" _/var_, and you can move to _/var/log_ in two ways - either by providing the full path with _cd /var/log_ or simply the "relative" path with the command _cd log_
* a simple _cd_ will always return you to your own defined "home directory", also referred to as _~_ (the "tilde" character) [NB: this differs from DOS/Windows]
* what files are in a folder? The _ls_ (list) command will give you a list of the files, and sub folders. Like many Linux command, there are options (known as "switches") to alter the meaning of the command or the output format. Try a simple  _ls_, then  _ls -l -t_  and then try  _ls - l -t -r -a_
* by convention, files with a starting character of "." are considered hidden and the _ls_, and many other commands, will ignore then. The _-a_ switch includes them. You should see a number of hidden files in your home directory.
* a note on switches: Generally most Linux command will accept one of more "parameters", and one or more "switches". So, when we say _ls -l  /var/log_ the "_-l_" is a switch to say "long format" and the "_/var/log_" is the "parameter". Many commands accept a large number of switches, and these can generally be combined (so from now on, use _ls -ltra_, rather than _ls -l -t -r -a_
* in your home directory type _ls -ltra_ and look at the far left hand column - those entries with a "d" are directories (folders) rather than files. They may also be shown in a different color or font - if not, then adding the "-G" switch should do this (i.e.  _ls -ltraG_)
* you can make a new  folder/directory with the _mkdir_ command, so move to your home directory, type _pwd_ to check that you are indeed in the correct place, and then create a directory, for example to create one called "test", simply type _mkdir test_. Now use the _ls_ command to see the result.


## WRAP
Being able to move confidently around the directory structure at the command line is important, so don’t think you can skip it! However, these skills are something that you’ll be constantly using over the twenty days of the course, so don’t despair if this doesn’t immediately “click”.

## EXTEND YOURSELF
If this is already something that you’re very familiar with, then:

* Take the time today to understand how the environment variable PS1 etc work (this article: [Bash Shell: Take Control of PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PROMPT_COMMAND
](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/bash-shell-take-control-of-ps1-ps2-ps3-ps4-and-prompt_command/) is a good start). 
* Set yourself up with a custom prompt using the information in [Bash Shell PS1: 10 Examples to Make Your Linux Prompt like Angelina Jolie](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/09/bash-shell-ps1-10-examples-to-make-your-linux-prompt-like-angelina-jolie/)
