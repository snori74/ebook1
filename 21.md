**INTRO**

Day21? What is this madness – surely the course was for just 20 days?

Yes, but hopefully you’ll go on learning, so here’s a few suggestions for directions that you might take

**Play with your server**

You’re familiar with the server you used during the course, so keep working with it. Maybe uninstall Apache2 and install NGINX, a competing webserver. Keep a running stat on ssh “attackers”. Whatever. A free AWS will last a year, and a $5/mo server should be something you can easily justify.

**Add services that you’ll use**

You should now be capable of following tutorials on installing and running your own instance of Minecraft, Wordpress WireGuard VPN or Mediawiki. Expect to have some problems – it's all good experience!

**Extend your learning**

Spend your free “surfing” time avoiding articles on Gnome, KDE or i3 – and checking out any articles like “*20 Linux commands every sysadmin should know*”. Try these out, delve into the options. Like learning a foreign vocabulary, you will only be able to use these “words” if you know them!

**Certs**

If you’re looking to do Linux professionally, and you don’t have an impressive CV or resume already, then you should be aiming at getting a cert. There are really just three certs/tracks that count:

\* CompTIA Linux+

[https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/linux)

\* LPI LPIC-1: Linux Administrator

[https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/Main\_Page](https://wiki.lpi.org/wiki/Main_Page) – VERY extensive description of the coverage of their various certs/courses.

\* Red Hat

[https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/all-certifications-exams) – You could spend a lot of time and money here! (but it might well pay off)

Even if you don’t want/need certs, the outline of the topics in these references can give you a good idea of areas to focus on in your self-learning.

**Cheap professional training**

* LinkedIn Learning
* Udemy

* CBT Nuggets

All the best!
