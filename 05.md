# Day 5 - More or less...

## INTRO

Today we'll end with a bang - with a quick introduction to five different topics. Mastery isn't required today - you'll be getting plenty of practice with all these in the sessions to come!

Don’t be misled by how simplistic some of these commands may seem - they all have hidden depths and many sysadmins will be using several of these every day. 

## TASKS

Use the links in the Resources section to complete these tasks:

* Get familiar with using `more` and `less` for viewing files, including being able to get to the top or bottom of a file in `less`, and searching for some text

* Test how “tab completion” works - this is a handy feature that helps you enter commands correctly. It helps find both the command and also file name parameters (so typing `les` then hitting “Tab” will complete the command `less`, but also typing `less /etc/serv` and pressing “Tab” will complete to `less /etc/services`. Try typing `less /etc/s` then pressing “Tab”, and again, to see how the feature handles ambiguity.

* Now that you've typed in quite a few commands, try pressing the “Up arrow” to scroll back through them. What you should notice is that not only can you see your most recent commands - but even those from the last time you logged in. Now try the `history`  command - this lists out the whole of your cached command history - often 100 or more entries. There are number of clever things that can be done with this, but the simplest is to repeat a command - pick one line to repeat (say number 20)  and repeat it by typing !20 and pressing “Enter”. Later when you'll  be typing long, complex, commands this can be *very* handy.

* Look for “hidden” files in your home directory. In Linux the convention is simply that any file starting with a "." character is hidden. So, type `cd` to return to your "home directory" then `ls -l` to show what files are there. Now type `ls -la` or `ls -ltra` (the "a" is for "all") to show all the files - including those starting with a dot. By far the most common use of "dot files" is to keep personal settings in a home directory. So use your new skills with `less` to look at the contents of  `.bashrc` ,  `.bash_history` and others.

* Finally, use the `nano` editor to create a file in your home directory and type up a summary of how the last five days have worked for you.
