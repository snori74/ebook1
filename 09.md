# Day 9 - Ports, open and closed

## INTRO

Your server is now providing two services - *sshd* for remote login, and *apache2* for web access. These services are by default provided on specific well-known TCP/IP “ports” - 22  and 80.

As a sysadmin you need to understand what ports you have open on your servers, because each open port is also a potential focus of attacks. You need to be be able to put in place monitoring and controls on them as appropriate.

## INSTRUCTIONS

First we'll look at a couple of ways of determining what ports are open on your server:

* `ss` - this, "socket status", is a standard utility - replacing the older `netstat`
* `nmap` - this "port scanner" won't normally be installed by default

There are a wide range of options that can be used with *ss*, but first try: *ss -ltp*

The output lines show which ports are open on which interfaces:
    
    ss -ltp
    State       Recv-Q       Send-Q              Local Address:Port             Peer Address:Port       
    LISTEN      0            128                 127.0.0.53%lo:53                    0.0.0.0:*          
    LISTEN      0            128                       0.0.0.0:22                    0.0.0.0:*          
    LISTEN      0            128                             *:80                          *:*          
    LISTEN      0            128                          [::]:22                       [::]:*              
    
The network notation can be a little confusing, but the lines above show ports 80 and 22 open "to the world" on all local IP addresses - and port 53 (DNS) open only on a special local address.

Now install `nmap` with `apt install`. This works rather differently, actively probing 1,000 or more ports to check whether they're open. It's most famously used to scan remote machines - please don't - but it's also very handy to check your own configuration, by scanning your server:

    $ nmap localhost

    Starting Nmap 5.21 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2013-03-17 02:18 UTC
    Nmap scan report for localhost (127.0.0.1)
    Host is up (0.00042s latency).
    Not shown: 998 closed ports
    PORT   STATE SERVICE
    22/tcp open  ssh
    80/tcp open  http

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.08 seconds

Port 22 is providing the *ssh* service, which is how you're connected, so that will be open. If you have Apache running then port 80/http will also be open. Every open port is an increase in the "attack surface", so it's Best Practice to shut down services that you don't need.

## Host firewall
The Linux kernel has built-in firewall functionality called "netfilter". We configure and query this via various utilities,  the most low-level of which are the `iptables` command, and the newer `nftables`. These are powerful, but also complex - so we'll use a more friendly alternative - `ufw` - the "uncomplicated firewall".

First let's list what rules are in place by typing `sudo iptables -L`

You will see something like this:

    Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
	target 	prot opt source           	destination

	Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
	target 	prot opt source           	destination

	Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
	target 	prot opt source           	destination

So, essentially no firewalling - any traffic is accepted to anywhere.

Using `ufw` is very simple. First we need to install it with:

	sudo apt install ufw

Then, to allow SSH, but disallow HTTP we would type:

	sudo ufw allow ssh
	sudo ufw deny http

(BEWARE - do _not_ “deny” ssh, or you’ll lose all contact with your server!)

and then enable this with:

	sudo ufw enable

Typing `iptables -L` now will list the detailed rules generated by this - one of these should now be:

    “DROP       tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http” 

The effect of this is that although your server is still running Apache, it's no longer accessible from the "outside" - all incoming traffic to the destination port of http/80 being DROPed. Test for yourself! You will probably want to reverse this with:

    sudo ufw allow http
    sudo ufw enable
    
In practice, ensuring that you're not running unnecessary services is often enough protection, and a host-based firewall is unnecessary, but this very much depends on the type of server you are configuring. Regardless, hopefully this session has given you some insight into the concepts.

BTW: For this test/learning server you should allow http/80 access again now, because those `access.log` files will give you a real feel for what it's like to run a server in a hostile world.

## Using non-standard ports
Occasionally it may be reasonable to re-configure a service so that it’s provided on a non-standard port - this is particularly common advice for *ssh/22* - and would be done by altering the configuration in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Experts call this “security by obscurity” - equivalent to moving the keyhole on your front door in an unusual place rather than improving the lock itself - but it *does* effectively eliminate attacks by opportunistic hackers, which is the main threat for most servers.

## EXTENSION
Even after denying access, it might be useful to know who's been *trying* to gain entry. Check out these discussions of logging and more complex setups:
